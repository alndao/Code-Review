# AwesomePasswordChecker

## Project Overview

**AwesomePasswordChecker** is a password strength calculator tool that evaluates the strength of a password based on various security factors. The tool is designed to assess the complexity of a password and provide feedback to improve security.

This project started as an intern's prototype and has been industrialized to be an open-source, maintainable, and scalable application. The goal is to make this tool industry-ready while ensuring it follows best practices in terms of code quality, testing, and security.

## Features

- **Password Strength Calculation**: Evaluates the strength of passwords based on length, complexity, and other factors.
- **Checkstyle Integration**: Ensures code quality by enforcing a consistent coding style.
- **Unit Testing**: Ensures that all code works as expected through automated tests.
- **Performance Testing**: Measures the performance of the `ComputeMD5` method.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automatically checks code quality, runs tests, and builds/deploys the project.
