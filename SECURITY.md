## Security Best Practices

To ensure the security of this project, we follow these best practices:

- **Regular Updates**: We regularly update project dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
- **Static Analysis**: We use tools like [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/) for static code analysis to identify potential security issues.
- **Password and Key Management**: Sensitive data like API keys, passwords, and private keys should never be hardcoded. Please use environment variables or secret management tools (e.g., [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)).
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent common attacks such as SQL Injection, XSS, and Command Injection.

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: We run security scans using [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/) to identify vulnerabilities in the code.
- **Dependency Scanning**: We use [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) to keep track of security updates in our project dependencies.
- **Code Reviews**: All pull requests are reviewed by at least one other contributor to ensure that no insecure code is merged.
